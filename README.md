# My Neovim config... ~for now~ pre-Nixification

I am just learning Neovim and figured I should save myself from myself and make a repo from my config. I was keeping it here, but have now moved it almost completely as-is to being with the rest of my dot files and such that are managed with Nix and Home Manager: https://github.com/genebean/dots/pull/335
